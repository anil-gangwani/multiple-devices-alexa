This project is completly based on the [repo](https://github.com/kakopappa/arduino-esp8266-alexa-multiple-wemo-switch), all the hard work was done by kakopappa.

This library enables your esp8266 to simulate a Belkin Wemo switch. It can be discovered as a device by your Amazon Echo/Dot on the Smart home section. It supports calling the emulated device a custom name e.g. "Alexa, turn off test lights", where test lights is the custom name

The library supports emulating up to 14 switches using 1 ESP8266 chip.
